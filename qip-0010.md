## Abstract
The Quai protocol comprises a network of merge-mined blockchains, each running
two ledgers (Quai EVM ledger & Qi UTXO ledger), as described in
[qip-0002](qip-0002.md). As a result of this, some unique challenges arise with
regard to network identifiers. Specifically in cases where transactions are
referenced by hash, there is ambiguity about the processing context of that
data, which adds complexity to the protocol and external systems which interact
with the protocol.

This specification proposes a scheme for creating unique object identifiers
which also encode some contextual information that alleviates the
aforementioned challenges.

## Motivation
Since the network supports a cross-chain transaction type (aka ETX), it is
possible for one transaction to have an existing record in multiple chains. The
origin chain which emits the ETX will have a record of it. The destination
chain which must process the ETX will eventually have a record of it. And any
dominant chain between the two may have a reference to it as a pending ETX
crossing through its context.

When servicing an API request for a transaction by hash, there is no way to
determine which blockchain to query for that transaction hash. Ultimately some
search algorithm will exist, which queries multiple chains until the record is
found (if it exists at all). This lookup challenge exists for other node APIs
as well as other systems external to the protocol (e.g. Block explorers), and
results in complex and inefficient solutions.

This could be entirely mitigated if the transaction ID encoded the source and
destination chain information, which this specification intends to address.

## Specification
### Transaction Identifiers
Transaction identifiers will consist of a permuted transaction hash.
Specifically, the first four bytes of the hash will be bit-masked with the
origin and destination shard identifiers respectively. [qip-0002](qip-0002.md)
describes the encoding of shard identifiers. For this specification, we only
care that they are 9 bits in length.

| bits 0..8    | bits 9..15               | bits 16..24  | bits 25..255               |
|--------------|--------------------------|--------------|----------------------------|
| src shard id | hash(transaction)[9..15] | dst shard id | hash(transaction)[25..255] |

> Note: since shard identifiers are 9 bits, we include a 7 bits of the actual
> transaction hash as a spacer, so that the destination shard id starts at a
> round byte position.
